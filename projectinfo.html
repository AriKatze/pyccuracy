	        <a href="http://blogs.manicprogrammer.com/heynemann" target="_blank">Bernardo "I can't wait till you get home" Heynemann</a> was the creator of Pyccuracy. Currently working at <a href="http://www.globo.com" target="_blank">Globo.com</a> as Software Developer.<br /><br />
	        Before joining <a href="http://www.globo.com" target="_blank">Globo.com</a>, he was working at ThoughtWorks.<br /><br />
	        When working in a previous project, he witnessed huge benefits of applied Test-Driven-Development with Acceptance Tests.<br /><br />
	        Pyccuracy is born of that: the need to improve quality of delivered software. Quick response to change
	        and alignment with customer expectations are some of the concerns Pyccuracy was born to cather for.<br /><br />
	        Bernardo is working hard at improving agile and polyglot programming to better enable software delivery at Globo.com. He is <a href="http://blogs.manicprogrammer.com/heynemann" target="_blank">blogging sparsely</a> about his current experiences.<br /><br />
	        If you need to reach him, just leave a message in Pyccuracy's development group or e-mail/IM at heynemann *at* gmail *dot* com.

            <a href="http://manicprogrammer.com/cs/blogs/claudiofigueiredo/default.aspx" target="_blank">Claudio "jc" Figueiredo</a> is a contributer of Pyccuracy since the beggining having worked on it's .net predecessor, Accuracy. Currently working at <a href="http://www.globo.com" target="_blank">Globo.com</a> as Software Developer.<br /><br />

Always looking for "the best tool for the job". When one cannot be found, he does what any good developer should do:
- Builds one.<br /><br />

His interest in Pyccuracy is due to that: the need to improve quality of delivered software, and not finding any tool that delivers TDD for Acceptance tests.<br /><br />

Claudio is working hard at improving his agile and polyglot programming to better enable software delivery at <a href="http://www.globo.com" target="_blank">Globo.com</a>.<br /><br />

If you need to reach him, just leave a message in Pyccuracy's development group or e-mail/IM at jcfigueiredo at gmail dot com.
