        Test Syntax
    </div><br />
    <p>Here we discuss Pyccuracy's tests syntax.</p><br />
    
    <div class="subsection">
        Overall test structure
	</div><br />
	
    <p>The best way to learn about the test structure is to look at an example test.</p><br />
    
    <pre id="acc">
<span>As a</span> Google User
<span>I want to</span> search Google
<span>So that</span> I can test Pyccuracy

<span>Scenario</span> 1 - Searching for Hello World
<span>Given</span>
  I go to "http://www.google.com"
<span>When</span>
  I fill "q" textbox with "Hello World"
  And I click "btnG" button
<span>Then</span>
  I see "Hello World - Google Search" title

<span>Scenario</span> 2 - Searching for Monty Python
<span>Given</span>
  I go to "http://www.google.com"
<span>When</span>
  I fill "q" textbox with "Monty Python"
  And I click "btnG" button
<span>Then</span>
  I see "Monty Python - Google Search" title
	</pre> <br />
    
    <p>All the words in blue are keywords and each of them will be explained in the sections below.</p><br />
    <p>The important thing to notice here is how Pyccuracy test files are organized.</p><br />
    <p>Each file can contain one and only one story. That story is identified by the header (As a/I want to/So that).</p><br />
    <p>It can, though, contain as many scenarios as you want. Each scenario needs to feature a title that identifies it and an index. You can see the lines identifying scenarios like "Scenario 2 - Searching for Monty Python".</p><br />
    <p>Each scenario is divided in three areas: givens, whens and thens. Each of those areas can have as many actions as you want.</p><br />
    <p>If all those names feel weird, keep reading and you'll understand each of the concepts.</p><br /><br />
	<div class="subsection">
        Tests Header - As a / I want to / So that
	</div><br />
	
    <p>Following BDD's structure all Pyccuracy's stories need to begin with a As a/I want to/So that header. More about that is discussed in the <a href="test_conventions.html">test conventions page</a>.</p><br />

	<div class="subsection">
        Scenarios
	</div><br />
	
    <p>Each story (test file) can contain as much scenarios as you want/need.</p><br />
    <p>Scenarios are the executable pieces of your test. They will get executed by Pyccuracy in the order that you defined them, even though you should <b>TRY REALLY HARD</b> not to have scenarios that depend on the order they are executed.</p><br />
    <p>Every scenario begins with a line that says the index and purpose of this scenario, like "Scenario 1 - Testing something".</p><br />
    <p>Having proper naming of your scenarios not only improves your tests, but makes the end-run report more readable.</p><br />

	<div class="subsection">
        Given / When / Then
	</div><br />
	
    <p>Each scenario is composed of three sections: given, when, then.</p><br />
    <p>These sections correspond to the pre-conditions, the value being tested and the post-conditions, respectively.</p><br />
    <p>Even though Pyccuracy will run the actions independently of which section you put them in, it's of major importance to have them in the proper section.</p><br />
    <p>The impact of having actions in the wrong section are unreadable and unmaintainable tests.</p><br />

	<div class="subsection">
        Actions
	</div><br />
	
    <p>Actions are the cream and butter of Pyccuracy.</p><br />
    <p>They are the language bits that drive the browser for you. Actions are things like clicking a button or typing some text.</p><br />
    <p>They are expressed in a much more natural language so you can have more readable tests.</p><br />
    <p>Let's look at an example, the click of a button.</p><br />    
    <pre id="acc">
<span>I click</span> "some" <span>button</span>
	</pre>
	<p>Notice how natural that reads, even though you are just executing python code.</p><br />
	<p>There are loads of actions to learn. In order to know which have been implemented so far just go to the <a href="docs.html">docs</a> for the release you are using and you can learn details of each action.</p><br />
