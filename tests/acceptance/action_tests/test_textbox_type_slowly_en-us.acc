As a Pyccuracy User
I want to test type text action
So that I can make sure Pyccuracy works

Scenario 1 - Checking that we can type the text in the textboxes
Given
    I go to "textbox_tests.htm"
When
    I slowly fill "txtSomething" textbox with "Monty Python"
    And I slowly fill "txtSomething2" textbox with "Monty Python"
    And I slowly fill "txtSomething3" textbox with "Monty Python"
    And I slowly fill "txtSomethingElse" textbox with "Monty Python"
    And I slowly fill "txtSomethingElse2" textbox with "Monty Python"
    And I slowly fill "txtSomethingElse3" textbox with "Monty Python"
Then
    #The textboxes are filled
