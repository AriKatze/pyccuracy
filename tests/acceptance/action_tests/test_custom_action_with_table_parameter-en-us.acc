As a Pyccuracy User
I want to test the custom action with table parameter
So that I can make sure Pyccuracy works

Scenario 1 - Checking that a table is correctly passed down
Given
    I have the following registered users:
        | username | email   | password |
        | admin    | a@dd.cc | aidimin  |
    And I have the following products:
        | name   | price |
        | Apple  | 1.65  |
        | Banana | 0.99  |
    I go to "custom_action_with_table_parameter.html?url=http%20%31%40blabla.com&other=whatever;other"
When
    #The Page is Loaded
Then
    #The tables are loaded
